                        <p>The Cellar is Saint Louis' premiere beer exchange site. This beer enthusiast web site is for members only.</p>
                        <p>Members are able to upload their cellar inventory and list items on the trading block for other users to see.</p>
                        <p>If you find something on the trading block, feel free to make an offer to the owner of the item.</p>
                        <p>Users are responsible for their own transactions and actions.  The Cellar and the ownership group is not
                            in any way liable for the actions of the users.  This site was developed for fun, not to make money.  Please
                            treat all interactions as though you were speaking to your grandmother.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Members will all be reviewed upon registration.  We are looking for members interested in participating
                            in mutually beneficial trades.</p>

                        <p>Again,  all users will be verified prior to being able to access.  You may receive an email for the
                            site administrator verifying your identitiy prior to getting credentials.  It isn't a big process, we are just trying
                            to eliminate spamers, scamers, and bots.  The extra layer of security is to protect you.</p>
